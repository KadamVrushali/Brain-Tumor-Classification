# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This repository contains a deep learning project for brain tumor classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features. The models are trained on medical imaging datasets to accurately classify glioma, meningioma, no-tumor, and pituitary tumors.
